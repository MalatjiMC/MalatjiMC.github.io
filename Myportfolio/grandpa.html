    <h1>About my grandfather</h1>
    <p>My grandpa's name is K.R Malatji, I call him <i>"Gugu"</i>. He is in his 50's, born on the 10<sup>th</sup> of June.
My grandpa and I share the same month, our birthdays are actually a week apart.</p>
<p>What I like most about my grandpa is that he brings me sweets sometimes when he comes back from his work.Sometimes he can be so strict, he doesn't like it when i'm not wearing my shoes.Everytime I need something from him, I need to make sure that i'm wearing my shoes.</p>
<p>He also knows how to fix things, many things. He can fix a car, Tv's, stoves, fridges and many other things. Sometimes people bring things for him to fix and they give him money.</p>
<p>He does not like watching tv, the only thing he watches on tv is news and weather.<br>
But above all, my grandpa is the best.
