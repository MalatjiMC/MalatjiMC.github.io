    <h1>About my mother</h1>
    <p>My moms name is Castor, everyone calls her by her name except for me and my uncles. I call her <i>"mama"</i> and my uncles call her <i>"tati"</i>. I dont know her age, no one wants to tell me. Her birthday is on the 25<sup>th</sup> of August.</p>
    <p>My mother is my bestfriend, I spend most of the time with her when she's back from Jozi. I like it most when she takes me out for shopping.</p>
    <p>She is a fashion designer. People come to her whenever they have parties or weddings so that she can sew dresses for them. She also bought me a sewing machine, soon i'll be like her.</p>
    <p>My mom is a best mother ever!!!</p>
