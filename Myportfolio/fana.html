    <h1>About my uncle</h1>
    <p>My uncle's name is Kgomotso, some call him by his other name <i>"Arnold"</i>, and most of the people call him by his nickname <i>"Vafana"</i> which he doesn't like at all. I call him <i>"Malume"</i>. I dont know his age but he's taller than my mother and my mother is older than him. He's birthday is on the 19<sup>th</sup> of November.</p>
    <p>My Uncle and I have one thing in common, we are left handed. He likes taking me up to his shoulders, at first I was so scared, but now I like it.</p>
    <p>M uncle is the best!!!</p>
